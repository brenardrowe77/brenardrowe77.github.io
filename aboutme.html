    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Brenard Rowe but I go by "Brenny". I am currently studying computer science at the University of Rhode Island. I would say that my ultimate goal in life is to be free. To me, being free means being able to eat, travel, or do anything whenever or however I want. Financial freedom plays a big part in reaching this goal. While pursuiing this goal, I have many hobbies that I like to partake in. Some include basketball, fashion design, and video games. </p>
